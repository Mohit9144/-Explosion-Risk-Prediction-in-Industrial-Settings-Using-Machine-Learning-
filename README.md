# -Explosion-Risk-Prediction-in-Industrial-Settings-Using-Machine-Learning-
Developed a predictive ML system using sensor data (Temp, Pressure, Gas Conc.) to forecast explosion hazards in industrial settings. Deployed Random Forest/XGBoost for early risk classification (Low/Medium/High), moving safety from reactive alarms to proactive mitigation. Python was the core tool.
